# ungoogled-chromium-updater

[ungoogled-chromium for windows](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows) does not support automatic updates.

This program solves the issue by running in the background and keeping ungoogled-chromium up to date.

## Installation

Download the latest setup from [releases](https://github.com/free-bots/ungoogled-chromium-updater/releases).

After the setup is complete you should see a new application in your startup folder.
